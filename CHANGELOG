* Items containing URL:s shown as underlined
* Live search is now turned off automatically when "Show all" is selected.

New in 2.14
===========

* Added a Show All checkbox that shows the contents of the entire done.txt as well. good for checking old stuff. Note everything will be slow...
* Added possibility to use a tray icon. When the application is closed and tray icon is active, the application is minimized to tray instead. To quit, use the menu in the tray.
* Added support for coloring due: tagged lines depending on date
* Added support for same shorthand with due: dates as with thresholds. Thus due:+2d will set the due date to 2 days from now. +3w is three weeks from now and so on..
* Title now shows how many rows are shown of total
* Checking for updates is now more visible (and selectable). Of course, no data is ever sent. Just check a version.
* Added a 'hidden' feature of procrastination. either use due: or t: with the shortform and 'p' and todour will change the date to a random number of days up to the number you specify.
  so t:+10p will put a date in the coming 10 days. And it will also add a '+procrastinated' tag, so you know you maybe shouldn't procrastinate the task again :)

* Option to save deleted items in deleted.txt
* Remember the content of search window if turned off

* Threshold can have a +project or @context - stays hidden while there is an active task with that +project or @context
* Threshold task can be treated as inactives (thus not hidden, but displayed differently)
* Changed behavior: When editing a line with dates, a change of the dates will be respected as well (before the original date would be kept)
* Remember the state of the Context lock toggle button when closed

# Introduction

Todour is a simple and powerful task manager application that uses the [todo.txt](https://todo.txt) file format (with some variations).
This means that all the tasks are in a file, and this file is stored where you want it to be. 
With Todour, you can easily organize and prioritize your tasks without being locked into a tool or sharing any data. 

This manual will guide you through the basics of using Todour, including how to add and edit tasks, set recurrence, and use the different features of the application. With Todour, you'll be able to increase your productivity and achieve your goals in no time.

The application always operates on the todo.txt file in every operation. There is no cache and changes are directly reflected in the todo.txt file.

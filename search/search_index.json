This means that all the tasks are in a file, and this file is stored where you want it to be. With Todour, you can easily organize and prioritize your tasks without being locked into a tool or sharing any data. This manual will guide you through the basics of using Todour, including how to add and edit tasks, set recurrence, and use the different features of the application. With Todour, you'll be able to increase your productivity and achieve your goals in no time. The application always operates on the todo.txt file in every operation. There is no cache and changes are directly reflected in the todo.txt file. Key Features todo.txt Format : Full compatibility with the todo.txt standard Advanced Date Handling : Support for relative dates ( due:+3d , t:+1w ) Recurrence : Automatic task recreation with rec: tags Threshold Dates : Hide tasks until a specific date with t: tags Priority Management : Standard A-Z priority support Project & Context : Full +project and @context support System Tray : Run minimized to system tray Global Hotkeys : Quick access from anywhere Undo/Redo : Full operation history Live File Watching : Automatic refresh when file changes Cross-Platform : Windows, Linux, and macOS support Installation Windows Download the latest release from nerdur.com Extract the archive to your preferred location Run Todour.exe (Optional) Create a desktop shortcut for easy access Linux Ubuntu/Debian Either Download the latest release from nerdur.com (either tar.gz or the deb file) Install whatever you chose to download.
